The API used in the tutorial was no longer available for free, so I had to find a suitable alternative using Rapid API. It was my first time working with a REST API, so I had to familiarize myself with the API structure and understand how to use the different API endpoints effectively. Despite the initial hurdle, I was able to create a better version of my application and gained valuable experience in working with API endpoints. Throughout the development process, the use of { console.log() } and { Chat-GPT's asistance }played crucial roles in my learning journey.",

Using Three.js seemed a bit overwhelming at first, but the 3D aspect really excited me to develop this project. Here, I learned how to apply 2D images over 3D shapes using decals and many more things like the positioning of 3D models and playing with their placement and tilt effects.
